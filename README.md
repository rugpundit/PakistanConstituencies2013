Pakistan General Election Constituencies 2002-2013

The shapefiles contain Pakistan Election Constituencies boundaries valid for General Elections from 2002-2013 and By Elections conducted from General Election 2002 to General Election 2018.

Election Commission of Pakistan delimited these National and Provincial Assemblies boundaries in 2002. These shapefiles were digitized from Election Commission of Pakistan's maps found on their website http://ecp.gov.pk in the form of PDFs and JPGs. 

The boundaries might not be 100% accurate according to structures on ground as these are not official Election Commission of Pakistan's digitized maps and errors and ommissions are expected in digitzing from low-resolution source files where there is no information available to make them more accurate. Another factor to take into account is slight changes in delimitation in many constituences before General Election in 2013 which were not incorporated into these shapefiles as ECP released no geospatial information about the changes. 

However, these constituency boundary maps are good for most visualizations and served most election campaign needs in General Election 2013.
